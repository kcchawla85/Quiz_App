## Overview

Welcome to Quiz App v1.0! This is a simple quiz application built from scratch using Flutter and Android Studio. The app follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a focus on the four pillars: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

## Features

1. **True/False Questions:**
   - The app presents a series of pre-defined true/false questions.
   - Users can provide answers by selecting either true or false.

2. **Alert Feature:**
   - An alert feature notifies users when they reach the end of the quiz.
   - Upon reaching the end, the app automatically takes the user back to the first question.

3. **Score Tracker:**
   - The app includes a score tracker to monitor the user's performance.
   - The score is updated based on the correctness of the answers provided by the user.

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles

The codebase incorporates the following OOP principles:

1. **Abstraction:**
   - The application design emphasizes abstraction by defining classes and interfaces to represent the quiz structure.
   - The internal implementation details are encapsulated, providing a simplified interface for users to interact with.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulation is maintained by bundling data and methods related to each question within a dedicated class.
   - The internal details of question handling are encapsulated to ensure modularity and maintainability.

3. **Inheritance:**
   - Inheritance is leveraged to create a hierarchy of question types, promoting code reuse and extensibility.
   - Different question types can inherit common attributes and methods from a base class.

4. **Polymorphism:**
   - Polymorphism is utilized through method overriding, allowing for flexibility in handling different question types.
   - The app can seamlessly handle variations in question behavior without modifying the core logic.
